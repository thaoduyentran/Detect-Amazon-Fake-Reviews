Amazon is one of the world's most successful technology companies, known worldwide for its e-commerce, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence capabilities. What started as an online bookstore in 1994, founded by Jeff Bezos, quickly rose above its competitors as Bezos realized the value of the e-commerce industry and expanded the company's offerings. As of now, nearly three decades after its conception, Amazon is one of the world's largest online markets, with over 12 million Amazon-branded products, as well as over 300 million marketplace products for sale1. In the U.S, Amazon accounts for 49% of the e-commerce market, and 5% of all retail spending.2 To better understand how Amazon operates and generates value, we can assess its value chain model. A company's value chain can be studied to see gaps and opportunities for expansion. Evaluating each phase in a company's value chain allows us to find opportunities for development, specific to said phase. The design, implementation, and, subsequently, optimization of Amazon's value chain analysis are vital to the company's success.
