One of the most frequently encountered issues on Amazon is the use of phony positive reviews to increase sales of certain products. According to data gathered from Fakespot, a company that specializes in the identification of fake reviews and counterfeits for online retailers, the number of phony Amazon reviews is predicted to be between 40% and 45% of all global reviews as of June/July 2020.

To have a better look at this issue, we examined Amazon’s historical statistics for the years 2008 and 2018 (from June 1st to September 30th). We chose these years as they can give us a good understand of the decade-long differences/similarities between Amazon usage and reviews, and these months do not include any major holidays, which can often overinflate reviews and purchases due to spikes in sale deals and offerings. Additionally, we use comments from Amazon’s “Electronics” category, as it is one of the most popular product categories available, which means it also has the highest number of reviews and review diversity. According to the Amazon website, to become a verified customer, an account must spend at least $50 on Amazon in the preceding 12 months or purchase a product without receiving a significant discount; this will be important for our analysis, which will sometimes include splits between verified and unverified reviews.
